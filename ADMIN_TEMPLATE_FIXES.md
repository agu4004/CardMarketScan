## Notes for Users

### Supported Image Formats
- Direct links to: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Must be publicly accessible URLs
- Recommended size: At least 200x280px for good quality

### Best Practices
- Use reliable image hosting (avoid temporary links)
- Test image URLs before adding to ensure they work
- Keep URLs reasonably short for CSV compatibility
- Consider using image CDNs for better performance

### Troubleshooting
- If images don't load: Check URL accessibility
- CSV import issues: Verify image_url column is included
- Blank images: URLs may require HTTPS or have CORS restrictions
